# FakeCMD
JayMontana36's super customizable and ultra realistic FakeCMD.

## Goals & Objectives
* Replicate the real command prompt (and any commands or utilities that are typically used from within a command prompt) as best and as closely as possible.
* Provide a simple and effective useable template via a modular platform design that can be very easily modified to fit another use case or purpose (such as scambaiting).
* Be somewhat educational and/or a stepping stone or good/decent guidance for those who are interested in learning how to script/code and/or learn Lua.

## Cusomization & Configuration
See [FakeCMD.lua](https://github.com/JayMontana36/FakeCMD/blob/master/FakeCMD.lua)'s included (and well documented) example samples, most notably [ipconfig](https://github.com/JayMontana36/FakeCMD/blob/ac178c5ed62d984573f15e49886842aa83a5ac7b/FakeCMD.lua#L58) and [echo](https://github.com/JayMontana36/FakeCMD/blob/ac178c5ed62d984573f15e49886842aa83a5ac7b/FakeCMD.lua#L82).
